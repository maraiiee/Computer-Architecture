 Binary System and Data Representation

    Binary (Base 2): Used by computers because it matches the on/off (1/0) nature of electrical circuits.

    Decimal vs Binary:

        Decimal (Base 10): Uses digits 0–9, with each position representing a power of 10.

        Binary: Uses only 0 and 1, with positions representing powers of 2.

        Example: 3687 (decimal) = 0b111001100111 (binary) = sum of various powers of 2.

    Bit: Short for binary digit. Smallest unit of data, either 0 or 1.

    Byte: 8 bits. Can represent 256 values; enough to store a single text character.

    Data Sizes:

        1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1024 bytes (2¹⁰)

        1 Megabyte (MB) = 1024 KB = ~1 million bytes

        1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1024 MB = ~1 billion bytes

        1 Terabyte (TB) = 1024 GB = ~1 trillion bytes

        1 Petabyte (PB) = 1024 TB

        1 Exabyte (EB) = 1024 PB = ~1 quintillion bytes

Digital Data & Text Encoding

    Binary Code: The basic language of computers; represents all instructions and data.

    Text Representations:

        ASCII and EBCDIC: Use fixed sets of bits, mostly for English characters.

        Unicode: Encodes characters from all writing systems, uses 1–4 bytes per character, supports 1+ million characters.

        Unicode is now standard for web applications and programming languages like Java and Python.

Computer Hardware: Motherboard

    Motherboard: Central circuit board of the computer; connects and coordinates all components.

3. Increasing Graphic Design Speed (Corel Example)
Tips for Speed & Efficiency:

    Customize keyboard shortcuts:

        “Q” for Wireframe mode (faster object selection).

        “C”, “E”, “P”, “R”, “F” for alignments.

    Use mouse scroll wheel for fast zooming in/out.

    Drag + right-click to duplicate objects quickly.

    CTRL + D duplicates object with same displacement.

    Transformation tools: replicate objects by exact measurements (e.g., 0.25”).

    CTRL + A: Select all.

    Find and Replace: Swap colors efficiently.

    Add frequent colors to custom palette to avoid repetitive selection.

    Use artistic text instead of paragraph text to avoid frame issues.

 4. Design Efficiency Process
 Pre-Design Methodology:

    Set document size first (e.g., tri-panel brochure: guide at 3.67" and 7.4").

    Dump all content in the workspace:

        Logos, slogans, text, pictures (unformatted).

    Set constraints:

        Font choices, color scheme, printing limitations (bleed, spot/full color).

    Format last:

        Once content is visible, creatively design and organize.

    Start with easy elements first to build creative momentum.

Benefits:

    Avoids issues during formatting.

    Saves time and prevents layout redesign.

    Keeps client requirements in mind from the start
